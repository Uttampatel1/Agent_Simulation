**I. Agent Behavior & AI Deepening:**

1. **More Complex Needs:**
    - **Thirst:** Requires access to water sources (new resource type/terrain feature).
    - **Sleep:** A distinct need separate from just low energy, potentially requiring a safe place (house/base) and occurring during specific cycles (e.g., mostly at night). Lack of sleep severely impacts performance.
    - **Social Interaction:** A need to interact with other agents, reducing stress or increasing happiness. Loneliness could have negative effects.
    - **Entertainment/Boredom:** Agents getting bored with repetitive tasks, seeking variety or specific "leisure" activities/locations.
    - **Hygiene/Cleanliness:** Could impact health.
    - **Safety/Fear:** Agents reacting to perceived threats (predators, environmental hazards, hostile agents) by fleeing, hiding, or alerting others.
2. **Personality & Traits:**
    - Give agents unique, persistent traits (e.g., hardworking/lazy, brave/timid, curious/cautious, social/loner).
    - These traits influence decision-making priorities (e.g., a lazy agent rests more, a brave one might face danger).
    - Could include skills that improve over time (gathering speed, building speed, combat proficiency).
3. **Learning & Memory:**
    - **Remembering Locations:** Remembering good resource patches, dangerous areas, location of their home/base.
    - **Path Preference:** Learning more efficient or safer paths over time.
    - **Simple Conditioning:** Avoiding actions/locations that led to negative outcomes (e.g., getting hurt by a predator).
    - **Skill Improvement:** Getting better at tasks (faster collection, building) through repetition.
4. **Emotions & Mood:**
    - A simple mood state (happy, content, stressed, sad, scared) influenced by needs fulfillment, social interactions, events, and personality.
    - Mood affects decision-making and efficiency.
5. **Life Cycle:**
    - **Aging:** Agents progress through life stages (child, adult, elder), potentially affecting speed, energy decay, skills, and eventually leading to natural death.
    - **Reproduction:** Conditions required (e.g., food surplus, housing, maybe pairing), leading to new agents (children needing care).
    - **Inheritance:** Simple passing of traits/skill potentials from parents.

**II. Social Systems & Interactions:**

1. **Communication:**
    - **Simple Signals:** Agents visually signaling others (e.g., "Danger!", "Resource Found!", "Need Help!"). Could be a visible effect or influence nearby agents' states.
    - **Information Sharing:** Telling others about known resource locations or dangers (requires memory).
2. **Relationships:**
    - Tracking simple relationship values (positive/negative) between agents based on interactions (helping, hindering, proximity).
    - Influences cooperation, conflict avoidance/initiation, social grouping.
    - Family units or friendships could emerge.
3. **Cooperation & Roles:**
    - **Task Allocation:** Agents coordinating tasks (e.g., one group collects wood, another builds). This could be explicit or emergent based on needs/roles.
    - **Specialized Roles:** Beyond Collector/Builder - e.g., Doctor/Healer (needs health system), Teacher (transferring skills?), Guard (needs threats), Farmer (needs agriculture).
    - **Helping:** Agents helping others fulfill needs (e.g., sharing food if relation is high and other is starving).
4. **Conflict:**
    - **Resource Competition:** Agents potentially competing or even fighting over scarce resources.
    - **Territoriality:** Claiming areas around homes or resource patches.
    - **Defense:** Agents defending themselves, others, or the base against threats.

**III. Environment & World Dynamics:**

1. **Time & Cycles:**
    - **Seasons:** Affecting temperature, plant growth, resource availability, day/night length, agent needs (e.g., need for warmth in winter).
    - **Weather:** Rain (creates mud, boosts plant growth), Storms (danger, reduced visibility), Fog (reduced visibility), Heatwaves (increased thirst/energy decay).
2. **Ecosystem:**
    - **Flora:** Plants with life cycles (growing, seeding, dying), affected by seasons/weather. Different plant types providing different resources.
    - **Fauna:** Passive animals (huntable for food?), Predators (threats), other competing species.
    - **Resource Scarcity:** Resources not just regenerating but potentially depleting permanently or migrating. Finite resources drive exploration and potential conflict.
3. **Physics & Environment Interaction:**
    - **Terrain Modification:** Agents digging, changing terrain slightly.
    - **Temperature:** Affecting agents (need warmth/cooling).
    - **Resource Properties:** Wood needing cutting, stone needing mining (requires tools?).
4. **Dynamic Events:**
    - Resource booms/shortages.
    - Natural disasters (fires spreading, floods).
    - Migrations of animals/predators.
    - Disease outbreaks (requires health system).
5. **Exploration & Discovery:**
    - **Fog of War / Limited Vision:** Agents (and potentially the player) only see a limited area around them, needing to explore to reveal the map and find resources/dangers.
    - Discovering new resource types or areas.

**IV. Economy & Resource Management:**

1. **More Resource Types:** Wood, Stone, Food types (berries, meat), Water, Minerals, Fiber, etc.
2. **Inventory & Storage:**
    - Limited personal inventory for agents.
    - Need for dedicated storage buildings (granaries, sheds) with limited capacity. Resource decay in storage?
3. **Crafting & Technology:**
    - Using basic resources to craft tools (axe, pickaxe, basket) that improve efficiency.
    - Crafting building materials.
    - Potentially a simple "research" mechanic to unlock new crafting recipes or building types.
4. **Buildings:**
    - Houses (better rest, safety, required for reproduction?).
    - Workshops (required for crafting specific items).
    - Defensive structures (walls, towers).
    - Storage buildings.
    - Community buildings (gathering place?).
    

**V. UI & Player Interaction:**

1. **Graphs & Statistics:** Visualizing population trends, resource levels, average needs over time.
2. **Detailed Agent Panels:** Selecting an agent shows their detailed needs, mood, traits, skills, inventory, relationships, current thought/goal.
3. **Player Goals/Directives (Optional):** Allowing the player to set high-level goals for the community (e.g., "Build more housing," "Stockpile food," "Explore north") or even directly command individual agents (though this moves away from pure simulation).
4. **Event Notification System:** More prominent display of important events from the log.
5. **Improved Camera Controls:** Smoother zooming and panning.
6. **World History/Timeline:** A record of major events, births, deaths.
